# DriverPass Project
The DriverPass project was designed as a comprehensive system for Liam, owner and operator of the DriverPass school. This system required a user-friendly online platform to manage various business operations. The client requested a system which allowed users to book, cancel, and modify driving lessons online or over the phone, access course materials, take practice tests, and track their progress.

# Project Highlights
One of the strengths of this project was the detailed and thorough documentation. This included UML diagrams, activity diagrams, sequences diagrams, and use-case diagrams. These diagrams provide a clear blueprint of the system's design and functionality. The diagram also helps visualize the system workflow and identify potential issues early in development.

# Needed Revisions
A key revision that should be made to this project would be during the initial analysis and information gathering phase. More direct interaction and input from potential users through surveys or interviews would provide deeper insights into customer needs. This would help improve the accuracy of our system design and ensure a user focused design.

# User Needs
Understanding user needs and implementing them into the system design was a central focus of this project. Using a detailed interview with the owner and two representatives of DriverPass, I was able to take common user stories or use cases, and translate them into actionable design. This was done by walking through the each story from the perspective of the user and the system. Considering the user's needs in relation to the system is crucial during the design phase, as it directly impacts the usability and effectiveness of the final product.

# Design Approach
Approaching software design in an iterative but structured and methodical approach is essential. This requires a requirements analysis, creating design documents, and iteratively developing based on these documents. Techniques such as user stories and use case help guide implementation.

In the future, I would leverage other aspects of the agile method and include a cycle of continuous user feedback that informs each development cycle. This approach would not only improve design, but ensure client satisfaction.
